        Mimivirus is the largest and most complex virus known.  <br> Is it an evolutionary bridge between nonliving viruses and living organisms, or is it just an anomaly? <br>
        Aa Aa Aa
        Viruses are small and fairly simple. <br> At least that's what many people probably assume. With the discovery of Mimivirus — the largest, most complex virus currently known — these assumptions may need to be reevaluated. <br>  This giant virus has a much larger size and bigger genome than any other known virus. Analysis of this intriguing virus may shed light on basic questions of viral evolution and, perhaps, the origins of life. <br>
        
        When most people think about viruses, they probably first think about diseases. <br>  Flu, polio, AIDS. We all know that viruses have caused immeasurable suffering throughout human history. <br>  And when asked to describe a virus, most people probably would say, "small." Indeed, viruses were first identified as filterable infectious agents (Beijerinck 1898; Ivanofsky 1892) — entities that could cause an infection and pass through a filter small enough to exclude almost all bacteria.  <br> 
        
        Their small size and inability to carry out translation — the formation of polypeptides from messenger RNA — often are highlighted as two defining characteristics of viruses. They seem to share little else. Some viruses have RNA genomes, and some have DNA genomes. Some have single-stranded genomes, and others have double-stranded genomes. Some possess envelopes, while others do not. And structurally, viruses display a wonderful array of shapes. The discovery of the giant Mimivirus certainly forces us to rethink our assumption that viruses are small. Analysis of this virus also may cause us to rethink our assumptions about the tree of life. <br>
        
        Discovery and Analysis of the Giant Mimivirus
        
        An electron micrograph shows an amoeba that has been invaded by a Mimivirus. <br> A scale bar represents 2 microns, and the amoeba measures approximately 10 microns across. A circular, approximately 2-micron region in the amoeba's center is the nucleus. A darkly-shaded circular region of similar size is the viral factory. Congregating alongside the viral factory's border are approximately 20 Mimivirus virions. These are smaller, 0.5 to 1 micron circles, each with a circular black patch in its center. <br> 2-4 virions are separated from the region surrounding the viral factory and scattered around the cell. <br>

        First observed in 1992, Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus (APMV) presents an interesting story of scientific inquiry. <br> During the investigation of a pneumonia outbreak, researchers noticed particles resembling Gram-positive bacteria residing within amoebae isolated from a water-cooling tower. <br> Because other bacterial species that cause pneumonia, like Legionella pneumophila, reside within amoebae (Rowbotham 1980), the investigators hypothesized that they had found another pneumonia-causing bacterium. Subsequent research, however, showed that they had identified not a bacterium, but a giant virus (La Scola et al. 2003). <br>
        
        Indeed, the most dramatic feature of this virus is its size. Researchers, in fact, named it Mimivirus — short for "mimicking microbe" — to reflect its large size and apparent Gram-staining properties (Figure 1). The virus has a capsid diameter of 400–500 nanometers (nm) and a total particle diameter, including fibers extending out from the capsid, of approximately 750 nm (Xiao et al. 2005). <br> A second strain of APMV, currently referred to as "mamavirus," may be even larger (La Scola et al. 2008). <br> These APMV strains dwarf all other known viruses and exceed the size of several well-characterized bacteria. <br> Poliovirus particles, in comparison, have a diameter of only 30 nm, which is roughly 10,000 times smaller than a grain of salt. Even the relatively large, brick-shaped poxviruses, such as smallpox virus, usually measure about 200 nm wide and 300 nm long — not even half the size of Mimivirus. <br> At approximately 1.2 million base pairs (Raoult et al. 2004), the linear, double-stranded DNA genome of Mimivirus far exceeds the size of any other known virus and a number of bacteria. Again, as a point of comparison, poliovirus has a genome of only 7,500 nucleotides, and the smallpox virus genome is about 200,000 nucleotides long. <br>
        
       <b> The Mimivirus Genome</b>
        While the size of Mimivirus certainly stretches our common perceptions of viruses, researchers have been more interested in the types of genes found within the Mimivirus genome. This information, they reasoned, could help us understand the evolutionary history of Mimivirus and, perhaps, shed some light on the more basic question of the history of all viruses. To carry out this type of analysis, genes within the Mimivirus genome would need to be compared to genes of other organisms. When organisms share similar genes, we can hypothesize that they share an evolutionary heritage.
        
        Using standard sequencing techniques (Adams 2008), researchers first sequenced the entire 1,181,404-base-pair Mimivirus genome (Raoult et al. 2004) and then analyzed the sequence. <br> They predicted that the genome contains 911 potential protein-coding genes, or open reading frames (ORFs; Raoult et al. 2004). <br> The human influenza virus genome, by contrast, encodes only 11 proteins; and the smallpox genome encodes fewer than 200 proteins. <br>
        
       <br> To further analyze this large virus, investigators next compared the putative Mimivirus genes to known gene sequences from other viruses and cellular organisms. <br> The results surprised them. Mimivirus appears to contain many ORFs previously identified in members of the nucleocytoplasmic large DNA virus (NCLDV) group, a group that also includes human pathogens like herpesviruses and smallpox virus. <br> However, the exact constellation of these genes in the Mimivirus genome does not match any of the known NCLDVs. <br> This result led investigators to postulate that Mimivirus probably represents the first identified member of a new class of NCLDVs (Raoult et al. 2004). <br>
        
        Although the presence of these NCLDV genes in Mimivirus is interesting, it might not seem surprising. <br> Given the structural similarities between Mimivirus and other large DNA viruses, we should expect these viruses to contain some similar genes. The identification of other genes, however, clearly surprised the microbiology community. <br> As the authors of the study note, the Mimivirus genome includes "many genes never before identified in a viral genome" (Raoult et al. 2004). More specifically, the Mimivirus genome appears to contain many genes needed for processes thought to be hallmarks of life: protein translation and metabolism. <br>
        
      <br>  Specifically, the Mimivirus genome contains a number of ORFs showing strong homology to genes that encode aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, the enzymes that link amino acids to their appropriate tRNA molecules. <br> Mimivirus also possesses several genes showing homology to translation initiation factors, other key components of translation. <br> In addition to these translation-associated genes, the Mimivirus genome includes genes associated with metabolic pathways, DNA repair, and protein folding. <br> Researchers now are investigating whether the virus utilizes proteins produced from these putative genes. <br> These investigations may reveal whether the genes are essential for Mimivirus replication.
        
        Certain other NCLDVs have been shown to possess a few translation-related genes. Among viruses, though, many of these genes appear to be unique to Mimivirus, and no other identified virus contains anywhere near the same number of these genes. If Mimivirus relies on its host for translation, then why would it possess so many genes related to this process? We still do not have a clear answer to this fundamental question. <br>
        
        Evolutionary History of Mimivirus <br>
        
        
        View Full-Size ImageFigure 2
        What can we conclude from this information? Like all other viruses, Mimivirus lacks ribosomes and depends on its host for translation. Mimivirus, however, contains a much more complete repertoire of translation-associated genes than does any other known virus. In interpreting this information, the authors of the initial report characterizing the Mimivirus genome postulated that Mimivirus may have evolved from a more independent ancestor (Raoult et al. 2004). Over time, they argue, Mimivirus lost some genes associated with translation as it became more dependent on its host. <br> The translation-like genes that we see in its genome today are relics of a previously intact translation machinery.  <br>Mimivirus, in other words, may represent evidence in support of the regressive model of virus origins. <br> Or perhaps, they note, Mimivirus represents a new branch on the tree of life, distinct from Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. <br> Raoult and Forterre (2008) even argue that we should reclassify all biological entities into two major groups: the ribosome-encoding organisms (archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes), or REOs; and the capsid-encoding organisms (viruses), or CEOs (Figure 2).
        
        Of course, the biological world rarely presents us with clear-cut answers to our questions. <br> In a separate analysis of the Mimivirus genome, other researchers provide a different explanation for the evolutionary history of this unusual virus. Moreira and Brochier-Armanet (2008) argue that the Mimivirus genes related to translation, DNA repair, and metabolism do not represent the remains of previously intact processes. Rather, they argue, Mimivirus acquired these genes over time via horizontal gene transfer (HGT). These genes, in other words, were acquired by Mimivirus from other organisms (Figure 3). <br> To support this assertion, these researchers note that some ORFs in the Mimivirus genome seem to show strongest homology to ORFs in bacteria, while other Mimivirus ORFs show strongest homology to ORFs in eukaryotes. <br> To logically explain this observation, they argue that some genes in Mimivirus may have been acquired from the amoeba host of Mimivirus. <br> Other Mimivirus genes may have been acquired from parasitic bacteria residing within the amoeba.<br> The amoeba, then, may serve as a genetic mixing bowl from which Mimivirus has gathered a complex set of genes (Moreira & Brochier-Armanet 2008). <br>
        
         <br>As often happens in scientific inquiries, the investigation of one question leads to unexpected findings and a host of new questions. As noted at the beginning of this article, the discovery of Mimivirus began during the investigation of a pneumonia outbreak. We still do not know, however, whether <b> Mimivirus causes pneumonia </b>. In one study, La Scola and colleagues (2005) reported that people with community-acquired pneumonia were more likely to have antibodies to Mimivirus than were people who did not have the disease. Although one can interpret this result as indicating that people with pneumonia are more likely to have been infected with Mimivirus, this result alone does not indicate that Mimivirus causes pneumonia. In another study (Khan et al. 2007), researchers showed that mice experimentally inoculated with Mimivirus developed tissue damage consistent with the development of pneumonia. <br> Again, we cannot conclude from this result that Mimivirus causes pneumonia. The result merely indicates that the virus, under certain experimental conditions, can cause tissue damage in mammals.
        
        Though the discovery and subsequent characterization of Mimivirus have not directly answered the original question about pneumonia, the studies of Mimivirus have opened the door to a whole host of other questions about the evolutionary history of viruses and the origins of life. Future studies of APMV strains certainly will provide us with important insight into these basic topics. <br> </h5> <br>

      <h5>  Mumps is a contagious disease caused by a virus. It can cause painful swelling in your parotid salivary glands (parotitis). Treatment for mumps focuses on alleviating symptoms. The disease has to run its course. Most symptoms are mild, but serious complications can occur. 
        
       
        Mumps is a contagious disease caused by the mumps virus, which belongs to a group of viruses known as paramyxoviruses. But then it typically leads to severe swelling in certain salivary glands (parotitis) that causes puffy cheeks and a tender, swollen jaw.
        
        After the mumps vaccine became available in 1967, the number of cases reduced significantly. However, mumps outbreaks still occur, especially among people who have prolonged close contact, such as on college campuses.

<h5>Who does mumps affect?
  Mumps most commonly affects children between the ages of 2 to 12 who haven’t received the mumps vaccine. However, adolescents and adults can get mumps despite being vaccinated against it. This occurs because there’s waning immunity of the vaccine after several years. Still, the best way to protect against mumps infection is to be fully vaccinated.  <br>
  
  <br>. Symptoms and Causes
 . What are the symptoms of mumps?
  The first mumps symptoms are often mild. Many people have no symptoms and don’t know they’re infected. Symptoms also don’t appear right away. The incubation period (the time between infection and illness) ranges from seven to 25 days.  <br>
  
  <br> <b>Mild mumps symptoms may include:</b>  <br>
  
 . Fever.  <br>
 . Headache.  <br>
 . Muscle aches.  <br>
 . Fatigue.  <br>
  Loss of appetite.  <br>
  <br> A few days later, painful swelling of your parotid glands may occur. Your parotid glands are salivary glands located between your ears and jaw. The swelling, known as parotitis, can occur on one or both sides of your face. This classic sign of mumps looks like “chipmunk cheeks” because your cheeks puff up and your jaw swells. Parotitis occurs in more than 70% of mumps cases.
  
  It’s important to remember that many different viruses and bacteria can cause parotitis. So it doesn’t always mean infection by the mumps virus.
  
  Rarely, mumps can affect your organs, including your brain, pancreas, testicles or ovaries. This usually only occurs in adolescents and adults, but call your child’s healthcare provider right away if they develop any of the following severe symptoms:  <br>
  
  <br> . High fever. <br>
  . Stiff neck.  <br>
  . Severe headache.  <br>
  . Confusion. <br>
  . Stomach pain.  <br>
  . Vomiting.  <br>
  . Seizures.  <br>
  . What causes mumps?  <br>
  <br>The mumps virus, which is a type of paramyxovirus, causes mumps. The virus spreads from person to person through direct contact with infected saliva or through respiratory droplets from the infected person’s nose, mouth or throat. The infected person can spread the mumps virus by:
  
  Sneezing, coughing or talking.
  Sharing objects containing infected saliva, such as toys, cups and utensils.
  Playing sports, dancing, kissing or participating in other activities involving close contact with others.
  Some groups of people are at a higher risk of getting mumps. These groups include:  <br>
  
  <br>. People with weakened immune systems.  <br>
 . People who travel internationally.  <br>
 . People who aren’t vaccinated against the virus.  <br>
 . People living in close quarters, such as college campuses  <br>
 . Is mumps contagious?  <br>
 <br> Yes, mumps is a very contagious viral infection. If your child has mumps, they’re contagious from a few days before their glands swell to up to five days after the swelling began. Therefore, your child should minimize contact with others. They shouldn’t go to school or childcare. Up to one-third of people with mumps don’t have any symptoms, but they can still be contagious.  <br>
  
  <br> . Diagnosis and Tests  <br>
 . How is mumps diagnosed?  <br>
 <br> Your child’s healthcare provider will ask questions about your child’s symptoms and perform a physical examination. They may be able to diagnose mumps based on their telltale swollen salivary glands. Your child’s provider may request specific tests to diagnose the condition.
  
  <br>. What tests will be done to diagnose mumps?
  <br> Your child’s healthcare provider may request a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test to diagnose mumps. They’ll swab the inside of your child’s cheek or throat to collect a sample of their mucus. They’ll send the sample to a lab, where a pathologist will examine it and look for the mumps virus. Your child’s provider may also request a blood test to help make the diagnosis of mumps or to rule out other conditions and viruses that can cause parotitis.  <br>
  
  <br> <b> Management and Treatment :</b> <br>
   <br>. The treatment for mumps focuses on relieving your child’s symptoms to make them as comfortable as possible. <br>
   <br> . The treatment for mumps focuses on relieving your child’s symptoms. <br>
  . How is mumps treated? <br>
  <br> There’s no specific treatment for mumps. The disease must run its course and usually goes away on its own within a couple of weeks. Mumps treatment focuses on alleviating your child’s symptoms to make them as comfortable as possible. The following steps can help manage symptoms:  <br>
  
  <br> . Drink plenty of fluids. <br>
  . Gargle warm salt water. <br>
  . Eat soft, easy-to-chew foods. <br>
  . Avoid acidic foods that make your mouth water. <br>
  . Suck on an ice pop to soothe a sore throat. <br>
  . Place ice or heat packs on swollen glands. <br>
  . Take non-aspirin medications such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen to reduce fever and help with pain. <br>
   <br>Don’t give your child aspirin. Children with viruses such as mumps who take aspirin can develop Reye’s syndrome, a dangerous disease that causes liver failure, swelling of their brain and even death.

  <h1>Types of herpes simplex virus</h1>
  <h5> There are two types of herpes simplex virus: <br>
 
 <br> . Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). <br>
  . Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). <br>
  <br> Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 can cause oral herpes or genital herpes. They also cause infections in other areas of your body. </h5>
  
  <h2><b>What parts of the body does HSV affect?</b></h2>
  <h5> Herpes simplex virus can cause infections in your: <br>
  
    <br> <b>. Mouth and face.</b> <br> An oral herpes infection causes cold sores on your lips and around your mouth. Some people develop herpetic gingivostomatitis (sores inside their mouths and other symptoms) when they first get infected. Rarely, sores develop on or inside your nose (nasal herpes). <br>
    <br> <b>. Genitals.</b>  <br>A genital herpes infection causes sores in your genital area, including the parts you can see (like your vulva or penis) and those you can’t see (like your cervix). <br>
    <br><b>. Skin on other areas of your body.</b> <br> HSV can infect your fingers (herpetic whitlow) or skin anywhere on your body (herpes gladiatorum). Eczema herpeticum, a widespread skin infection, is a complication of HSV infection that affects people with atopic dermatitis. <br>
    <br> <b>. Eyes.</b> <br> HSV can cause a serious eye infection called herpes keratitis (a type of ocular herpes). <br>
    <br> <b>.  Brain and spinal cord.</b> <br> HSV can infect your brain (herpes simplex encephalitis) or the protective layers surrounding your brain and spinal cord (herpes meningitis). If HSV infects both your brain and its protective layers, you can develop a life-threatening condition called herpes meningoencephalitis. <br>
    <br> <b>.  Other organs.</b> <br> HSV can affect one or more organs in your chest and belly, including your esophagus (herpes esophagitis), lungs (HSV pneumonia) and liver (HSV hepatitis). These types of infections are more likely to affect people who are immunocompromised. <br>
  Herpes simplex virus (HSV) can infect many different parts of your body, causing bumps and fluid-filled blisters to appear
  HSV can infect many different parts of your body, including your eyes, mouth area, genital area and fingers. <br>

 <br> <h1><b>Symptoms and Causes</b></h1> <br>
 <h2> What are the symptoms of a herpes simplex infection?</h2><br>
  <h5>The symptoms of an HSV infection vary according to the specific type of infection: <br>
  
    <br> <b>. Oral herpes.</b> <br> Blisters on your lips or around your mouth. Skin may tingle, itch or burn up to 48 hours before blisters appear. <br>
  Genital herpes.  <br>Blisters on and around your genitals. Symptoms in the 48 hours leading up to blisters appearing include fever, headache, swollen lymph nodes and itching or tingling in your genital area. <br>
  <br><b>. Herpes gladiatorum.</b> <br> Blisters anywhere on your skin but usually your hands, face, ears or chest. <br>
  <br><b>. Herpetic whitlow.</b> <br> Blisters on your fingers, discolored skin around your fingernail, swelling in your finger. <br>
  <br><b>. Herpes keratitis (eye herpes).</b> <br> Eye pain or irritation, feeling like there’s something in your eye, sensitivity to light, blisters on your eyelids or around your eyes. <br> 
  <br><b>. HSV encephalitis.</b> <br> Headache, fever, focal seizures, changes in speech or behavior. <br>
  <br><b>. Herpes meningitis.</b> <br> Headache, fever, sensitivity to light. <br></h5>
  <br> <h1><b>How do you get an HSV infection?</b></h1> 
  <br> <h5> You catch HSV through direct contact with someone who has an HSV infection. This means part of your body needs to touch someone else’s: <br>
  
    <br>. Herpes sores (oral or genital).<br>
    <br>.  Skin or mucosal surfaces (like mouth, vagina or <b>anus</b>), with or without visible sores. <br>
    <br>.  <b>Saliva</b>, semen or <b> vaginal discharge</b>, with or without signs of an infection. <br>
    <br> Someone with HSV doesn’t transmit (or “shed”) the virus from every part of their body. They only shed it from the area that’s infected. Usually, that’s the part of their body where HSV first entered. <br>
  
    <br> <b> For example</b>, someone with genital herpes can transmit the virus through the skin, mucosa and bodily fluids in their genital area only. They won’t spread HSV through their saliva — the exception, of course, is if they also have oral herpes (we’ll return to this later). <br>
  
    <br> Similarly, if your partner has oral herpes but not genital herpes, then you don’t have to worry about getting HSV from contact with their genitals. You’d only be at risk of catching HSV through contact with your partner’s mouth or saliva. <br>
  
    <br>If your partner has both oral and genital herpes, then it’s possible you could catch HSV from contact with their mouth area or their genital area. But exactly how the virus affects you would depend on which part of your body made that contact. This deserves a closer look. <br>
  
    
  
    <br> <h1><b>Herpes simplex incubation period</b></h1> <br>
  <h5>The incubation period for herpes simplex infections ranges from one to 26 days but is typically six to eight days. This is how long it takes for you to develop symptoms after first getting infected with HSV. <br>
  
    <br> Some people get infected but don’t develop symptoms right away. Instead, symptoms may not appear for months or even years until the virus reactivates. <br> </h5>
  
 <h2><b>What triggers herpes simplex virus?</b></h2> 
  <h5>Triggers that may cause an oral or genital herpes outbreak include: <br>
  
  <br>. Fever. <br>
  <br>. Stress. <br>
  <br>. Suppressed immune system (due to medications or an underlying condition). <br>
  <br>. Changes in hormones (for example, during menstruation). <br>
  
  <br> Potential triggers specific to oral herpes include: <br>
  
  <br>.  Sun exposure. <br>
  <br>. Upper respiratory infection. <br>
  <br>. Trauma to your mouth area. <br>
  <br>. Outbreaks can also occur randomly without any obvious trigger. <br></h5>
  
  <br> <h2><b>What are the stages of a herpes simplex infection?</b></h2>
   <h5>  An HSV infection has three stages:  <br>
  
    <br>.  Primary infection. <br>
    <br>.  Latency. <br>
    <br>. Reactivation. <br> </h5>
    <br> <h2><b>HSV primary infection</b></h2>  <br>
  <h5>A “primary infection” is what happens after HSV enters your body. The virus travels to nearby nerve cells, where it starts replicating. When HSV enters your mouth, it typically infects your trigeminal nerves. When it enters your genital area, it typically infects your sacral plexus (a network of nerves in your pelvis). <br>
  
    <br> HSV then travels through your nerves to nearby skin or mucosa. By this point, your immune system recognizes there’s an invader, and it starts sending out immune cells. This leads to inflammation and the formation of blisters on your skin. You may also notice swollen lymph nodes in that area (for example, underneath your jaw or along your groin). <br>
  
    <br>For some people, a primary infection causes no symptoms and they’re unaware they’re infected with HSV. <br> </h5>
  
    <br> <h3><b>HSV latency</b></h3>
  <h5>Within a few weeks, your immune system clears up the primary infection, but HSV stays in the nerve cells it first infected. Healthcare providers refer to this as latency. It means the virus is present in your nerve cells but mostly inactive (you might hear this described as the virus being “asleep”). <br>
  
    <br>During latency, most of the infected cells are sleeping, but a few are awake at any given time. Usually, this doesn’t cause an outbreak. Sometimes, infected cells “wake up” and cause enough of a stir that your immune system notices. This is HSV reactivation. <br></h5>
  
    <br><h3><b>HSV reactivation</b></h3> 
  <h5>Reactivation is when infected cells wake up and trigger an immune response. There are a few possibilities at this point:  <br>
  
    <br><b>.  Containment in nerve tissue.</b> There’s brief HSV activity but it begins and ends in your nerve cells. Your immune system contains the virus before it can travel to your skin or mucosa. This happens often in people with HSV — the virus wakes up, has a quick burst of activity (lasting about two to six hours) and then that’s it. You don’t shed the virus or have symptoms, and you don’t spread HSV to others. <br>
    <br><b>. Asymptomatic viral shedding.</b>  Some infected cells reach the outer layer of your skin (epidermis). There’s not enough viral activity to cause symptoms, but the virus may “shed.” This means the virus can leave your skin and infect someone else through direct contact. HSV commonly spreads from person to person during this shedding period. <br>
    <br><b>. Symptomatic herpes outbreak.</b> The infected cells replicate enough at your skin’s surface to cause symptoms. This is when you notice blisters on your skin, and it’s what most people associate with a herpes outbreak. The virus can easily spread to others through direct contact.  <br> </h5>
    <br>   <h1><b>Diagnosis and Tests</b></h1> <br>
 <h2>How do healthcare providers diagnose HSV infections?</h2> <br> 
  <h5>Healthcare providers diagnose HSV infections by doing a <b>physical exam</b> and testing. During an exam, your provider will look for signs of infection (like sores). They may take a sample from the sores to send for lab testing. If your provider suspects encephalitis and/or meningitis, they may do a <b>  </b>.  <br>
  
    <br> If you don’t have sores, your provider can use a <b>blood test </b>to check for <b> antibodies against</b> HSV-1 or HSV-2. Antibodies are a sign you’ve been infected with the virus in the past. Test results help your provider plan treatment. <br>

        <p class="card-text" ><h5>Epstein-Barr Virus
          Epstein-Barr virus is a common and highly contagious infection. It spreads through bodily fluids, especially saliva (spit). Some cases of the virus lead to mononucleosis and rare cases lead to cancer. Treatment addresses symptoms of the virus. </h5>
          
        
          <h2><b>Overview</b></h2>
         <h3><b></b>What is Epstein-Barr virus?</h3> 
        <h5>  Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a very common viral infection that spreads through saliva and body fluids. EBV is a type of herpesvirus called herpesvirus 4. Most cases of EBV don’t cause symptoms. <br>
          
          Once you get EBV, the infection stays within your body for your entire life in a dormant state where it's inactive or sleeping. You can reactivate the virus and experience symptoms again, regardless of when you first acquired the virus.</h5></p>

<h2><b> Who does Epstein-Barr virus affect?</b></h2> <br>
   <h5>  Most cases of Epstein-Barr virus affect children, teenagers and young adults, but anyone can get the virus. <br></h5>
    
   <br><h2><b>How common is Epstein-Barr virus?</b></h2> <br>
   <h5> Epstein-Barr virus is very common. In the U.S, an estimated 50% of all children up to 5 years of age and about 95% of adults experience an EBV infection in their lifetime.<br></h5>
    
   <br> <h2><b>How do you get Epstein-Barr virus?</b></h2> <br>
  <h5> Epstein-Barr virus is contagious and easily spreads through saliva (spit). You can get EBV by sharing items that make contact with an infected person’s saliva. Most people get EBV by drinking from the same glass or kissing someone with the virus.<br> </h5>
    
    <h1><b>Symptoms and Causes</b></h1>
    <br><h2><b>Is Epstein-Barr virus contagious?</b></h2> 
   <h5> Yes, Epstein-Barr virus is contagious. The virus can spread during the incubation period (amount of time when someone has exposure to the virus to when they experience symptoms), which is between four to six weeks.<br>
    
    <br>The virus spreads easily through saliva (spit) but can spread through other body fluids. You can get EBV from an infected person by:<br>
    
    <br>. Coughing or sneezing.<br>
    <br>. Kissing.<br>
    <br>. Sexual contact (blood and semen).<br>
    <br>. Sharing objects like a toothbrush, utensils or a cup.<br>
    <br>. Touching items a child might have put in their mouth or drooled on.<br>
    <br> If you have EBV, you don’t have to show symptoms to pass the virus onto someone else. Once you get the infection, it will live in your body in a dormant (sleeping or inactive) state. Certain events can trigger EBV to wake up (reactivate) and make it contagious to others, potentially causing symptoms in the host. Events that trigger EBV reactivation include:<br>
    
    <br>. Stress.<br>
    <br>. Weak immune system.<br>
    <br>. Menopause or hormone changes.<br> </h5>
    <br><h2><b>What causes Epstein-Barr virus?</b></h2>   
    <br> <h5>Close person-to-person contact causes the highly contagious Epstein-Barr virus. The virus spreads easily through saliva (spit) and other body fluids like blood and semen. The virus can also spread through blood transfusions or organ transplants. <br> </h5>
    
      <br> <h2><b>How does Epstein-Barr virus affect my body?</b></h2>
   <h5> The virus attaches to white blood cells (lymphocyte B cells) in your body. White blood cells help fight infection. When the virus attaches to your white blood cells, your cells are unable to fight the infection properly and you experience symptoms.<br> </h5>
    
    <br><h2><b>What are the symptoms of Epstein-Barr virus?</b></h2> 
    <br><h5>Symptoms range in severity for each person diagnosed with Epstein-Barr virus. Symptoms include: <br>
    
      <br>.  Sore throat and throat inflammation (swelling).<br>
      <br>. Fatigue or feeling extremely tired.<br>
      <br>. Fever.<br>
      <br>.Swollen lymph nodes (a bean-shaped organ in your neck).<br>
      <br>. Rashes on your skin.<br>
      <br>. Enlarged spleen and liver.<br>
      <br>Children diagnosed with Epstein-Barr virus either don’t show symptoms or their symptoms are similar to short-term illnesses like a cold or the flu. Teenagers or adults who get the virus may show symptoms between two to four weeks, but symptoms could linger for months, especially fatigue.<br></h5>
    
      <br> <h2><b>Do symptoms of Epstein-Barr virus reactivate?</b></h2> 
   <h5> Once you get Epstein-Barr virus, the infection deactivates (latent) or goes to sleep. The infection could wake up (reactivate), especially if you have a weakened immune system. Sometimes the virus does not cause symptoms in the host but it is still contagious to others.<br></h5>
    
    <br><h2><b>Diagnosis and Tests</b></h2> 
    <br><h2><b>How is Epstein-Barr virus diagnosed?</b></h2>
    <br><h5> It can be challenging for your healthcare provider to diagnose Epstein-Barr virus because the symptoms are similar to other common illnesses. Your healthcare provider will ask you about your symptoms, how long you’ve had them and if you’ve come into contact with anyone who might have the virus. Your provider might offer a blood test to confirm the diagnosis.<br></h5>
    
    <br><h2><b>What tests diagnose Epstein-Barr virus?</b></h2> 
    <br><h5>To confirm your diagnosis, your provider will perform a blood test called Epstein-Barr virus antibody test. This test takes a sample of your blood to detect antibodies that cause EBV. Your provider may need to repeat the test between 10 days to two weeks after the first test because antibodies might not show up early in your diagnosis.<br></h5>
    
      <br><h1><b>Management and Treatment</b></h1>
      <br><h2><b>How is Epstein-Barr virus treated?</b></h2>
      <br><h5>Treatment for Epstein-Barr virus addresses symptoms associated with the infection. Treatment includes:
    
  <br>. Staying hydrated and drinking plenty of fluids.<br>
  <br>. Resting.<br>
  <br>. Taking over-the-counter medicine for a fever and pain.<br>
  <br>  Getting enough rest is important to prevent symptoms from getting worse. It is especially important that you avoid excessive physical activity that could lead to a ruptured spleen if the virus causes your spleen to enlarge.<br></h5>
    
  <br><h2><b> How soon after treatment will I feel better?</b></h2>  
    <h5>People infected with Epstein-Barr virus who experience symptoms usually feel better after two to four weeks. Others might have lingering symptoms of fatigue where they feel very tired for several weeks or months after their initial infection.<br>
